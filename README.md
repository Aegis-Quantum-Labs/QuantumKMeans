# QuantumInspiredKMeans

QuantumInspiredKMeans is an open source Python project that implements a quantum-inspired version of the k-means clustering algorithm. This project leverages quantum concepts—such as randomness reminiscent of quantum superposition—for initialization and probabilistic assignments, enhancing classical clustering methods.

## Features
- **Quantum-inspired Initialization:** Uses randomness similar to quantum state superposition for initial centroid selection.
- **Standard k-Means Iteration:** Updates centroids and assigns clusters using Euclidean distance.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily integrated with other machine learning pipelines.
- **Visualization Tools:** Example scripts to visualize clustering outcomes.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumInspiredKMeans.git
cd QuantumInspiredKMeans
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the provided example:

```bash
python examples/example_usage.py
```

Or integrate the library into your own projects:

```python
from quantum_kmeans.kmeans import quantum_kmeans

# Your data as a NumPy array
import numpy as np
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # Example dataset
labels, centroids = quantum_kmeans(X, k=3)
```
